# WEEK 1: UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY üß†

Behaviour change starts with right-thinking. Here are a few thoughts on the approach for the next nine weeks. We want to get our mindset right so that we can confidently and happily change for the better and for good üí™üèº

## 1. **BODY NEUTRALITY NOT BODY POSITIVITY**

> Body neutrality is a philosophy that you should focus on **what your body can do for you** rather than what it looks like.

**LISTEN TO THIS** üëÇ ‚û°Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚û°Ô∏è

**Start at timestamp 2:40min**

(Total time: 5min)

**Disclaimer:** Body-positivity may tick all the boxes for you. Maybe you relate to it more and it can therefore be more helpful and powerful for you on your journey to healthy lifestyle change. Rock On üé∏ ü§ü

I personally think that **body-neutrality is more in line with the God's design for how we should view and appreciate our body, being mindful and grateful of the ways it helps us to live out Jesus' will for our lives**. I don't spend any time trying to love my stretch marks or my different size boobs. They just are what they are and they have nothing to do with my worth or general awesomeness and they don't significantly inhibit my ability to worship God with my life. My guitar does crush my one boob during worship but that's a whole different thing. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI don't see why anytime should be spent on actively finding ways to identify and appreciate your physical or sexual attractiveness üí™ Jog one with that shit. We have things to do. üíª

‚ö†Ô∏è If you do however think horrible things about your body and maybe you worry about your relationship with it - then consider opening up to a friend about it or connecting with a wellness coach or counsellor. I know some great peeps if you're looking for a professional. DM me if you're keen. üì¨

## 2. WEIGHT-LOSS IS NOT THE GOAL ‚öñÔ∏è

Weight-loss is hardly the goal of any sustainable healthy lifestyle change. It really isn't. Cue eye-roll...

![https://media.giphy.com/media/BB8Gx0CaEASHu/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/BB8Gx0CaEASHu/giphy.gif)

**You might be asking...what the hell am I here for if I'm not gonna lose weight?!** You will lose weight but that doesn't happen if you focus on the weight. It happens by slowly, I mean really slowly, adding and removing default daily settings so that you can get to a point where the weight-loss is just a wonderful by-product of your new lifestyle. Oh yeah baby!

Across the nine weeks we will discuss some tactics you can use to just get over the weight part of the whole process and focus on the lifestyle change. But it is important to think through what you think about your current weight and what a healthy and sustainable weight goal is for you. More on this later.

It's good to be in a healthy weight range for about a million health related benefits and to prevent a plethora of debilitating diseases so we need to establish what that weight range may be. **Most of these measures don't take into account muscle-mass, bone density etc., but they are a good general guide to establish a vague ball park of where you should sit.**

If you're looking to get very fancy and very accurate you can find a place that does a body composition test to give you a complete break down of your body. These are called DEXA scans. But ain't nobody got time or money for that. **So BMI will do for now.**

[Body Mass Index Calculator & Healthy BMI Range Chart For Women & Men](https://www.weightwatchers.com/nz/weight-loss-tools/bmi-calculator)

‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Check out this calculator to find your weight range on the BMI** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

It's don't matter if you're at level 3 Ms. Piggy obesity on the BMI like I was. Didn't know that there were 3 levels of obesity...well now you do. **Remember body-neutrality! It's just a body and it does so many good things for you each day.**

In any case...Miss Piggy has always been fabulous üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We'll do an inventory, a check in and set some goals (if you haven't already) in this week. So look out for that in the What's App group. You'll receive a worksheet and instructions as well üíå

## 3. It's not Rocket Science: Facts not Fads

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a not weight-loss program for people wanting to lose weight fast. ‚ö†Ô∏è This is for chubba-bubbas or lazy couch potatoes or middle of the road average Joe-anne's who want to get to a healthy weight range and be healthy and fit **#beastmode** üêª

If you want to do something and justify your actions, you can always find "research" that supports your choices on the internet. That approach is not ours. The world of wellness and nutrition is the most crowded with utter garbage, harmful fads and pseudo science - with the sole purpose of selling products. We are interested in facts not fads. So all of the content is well researched, effective for most people and as objective as possible. I will be presenting options and alternatives for different preferences as we go along. Again take what works, discard what doesn't. ‚úä

## Some of the topics we will be covering over the 9 weeks üì∞

-   Taking stock, photos, measurements, weight, caloric intake.
