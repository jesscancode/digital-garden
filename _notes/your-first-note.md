This is your first note. You'll find it in the [`notes/`](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/tree/master/_notes) directory. 

**Hey there you heartfelt ham nuzzlers!** üçñ

You've measured every nook and cranny of your body, you've taken progress tracking photos of your sweet ass, you've established a good caloric baseline for your goals and you've been tracking your calories...mostly. Now we are getting to the point where you've had a little time to adjust to this wellness journey, to scope it out, to experiment with a few things and to start thinking of what you really want. Now is the time to set some goals and concretize why you are doing all of this. #creatingvision #findingyourwhy #pithymotivationalhashtag

We are not going to be lame and set goals merely for this 10 week journey together. That is essential but we need to aim further, reach higher and dream bigger! #rockybalboa #eyeofthetiger

Before setting any goals...we all know that goals are nothing without accountability. When last did you decide to change a habit and find out you changed your behavior for 3 days and then reverted back to the previous habit. This is the powerful science of habit #charlesduhigg and the mechanisms in your brain and body are stacked against you in the beginning. #dontbeatyourselfup #beatyourhabitsup #bisheslietothemselves #satanisreal 

> **BUT and it's a BIG BUTT! We can hack this system. We can set ourselves up for success and it starts with helping each other with accountability. #sistersofFFFF**
> 

Different styles of accountability work for different people and we'll work with that. If we are all comfortable to share our goals with each other in the Whatsapp group too - that's cool but not a requirement. 

> **What is required is a personal submission to me: this next phase will require everyone to submit their goals to me for review, encouragement and accountability. More on this personal submission later #winningatlife**

## SOME PARAMETERS FOR US AS A GOAL-SMASHING TEAM üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Initial Time Frame: 3 Months**

**Medium Term Goal Crushing End Date: 1st February 2021**

So as living and breathing humans...we know that Christmas is one of the highlights of our calendar as we celebrate with expectation the coming of our Lord Jesus. Sadly it's also a field of landmines waiting to explode our wellness goals. I blame Woolworths, capitalism and gluttony. So in light of this...our medium-term date for goal setting is going to be **1 February 2021**. #youaremyguineapigs #yourestuckwithme #wewillovercome

The reason this date has been chosen is not to cramp your Christmas binge eating style but to insure that we keep each other accountable into the start of 2021. It is also to stop the Christmas cramming from eking it's way into the start of next year. #ourgoalsarebiggerthanChristmasham #weareallhamnuzzlers

## SURGICAL SURGEONS SURGEONING OUR GOAL SETTING

This week we're getting surgical with setting goals and a little bit on the fluffy side with designing our own vision boards. #digitalartsandcrafts ‚úÇÔ∏è #collage üñºÔ∏è #saywhat! üó£Ô∏è More on vision boards later. 

### BUT FIRST...GOAL DUMP

Yes yes, we all know this SMART goal setting system from high school Life Orientation. It is BASIC. But it works.

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable
- Realistic
- Timely or time-limited

![https://media.giphy.com/media/GSDP6bmdiZhxC/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/GSDP6bmdiZhxC/giphy.gif)

We will use this S.M.A.R.T framework but we need to mind dump all our goals first to cut through the non-essential and to select what is going to give us the most bang for our buck. Essentially we are searching for goals that we can turn into our core keystone habits. We will then build these goals into our lives to get us all the way to February 2021!

### Link syntax

To link to another note, you can use multiple syntaxes. The following four use the "double-bracket" notation ([view the Markdown source file](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/_notes/your-first-note.md#link-syntax) to see the underlying syntax).

- Using the note title: [[a note about cats]]
- Using the note's filename: [[cats]]
- Using the note's title, with a label: [[A note about cats|link to the note about cats using the note title]]
- Using the note's filename, with a label: [[cats|link to the note about cats using the note's filename]]

You can organize notes in subdirectories and link them normally. For example, the links above all point to the `_notes/animals/cats.md` file. Here's another example: [[tigers]].

Non-latin languages are supported too: [[ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî]].

Dashes and underscores in file names are supported, and may be omitted in the bracket link syntax. As an example, the `your-first-note.md` file can be linked to with [[your first note]] or [[your-first-note]], or even [[yOuR-FiRsT Note]].

In all cases, if the double-bracket link does not point to a valid note, the double brackets will still be shown, like this: [[there is no note that matches this link]].

Alternatively, you can use regular [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for links, with a relative link to the other note, like this: [this is a Markdown link to the note about cats](/cats){: .internal-link}. Don't forget to use the `.internal-link` class to make sure the link is styled as an internal link (without the little arrow).

Since the Web is all about HTML, you can always use plain HTML if you want, like this: <a class="internal-link" href="/cats">This is a link to the note about cats with HTML</a>.

Of course, you can also link to external websites, like this: [this is a link to Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/). Again, you can use plain HTML if you prefer. Footnotes are also supported and will be treated like internal links.[^1] You can point to other notes in your footnotes.[^2]

[^1]: This is a footnote. For more information about using footnotes, check out the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#footnotes).
[^2]: This is another footnote that links to the note about [[cats]]. You may also point to [[notes that do not exist]] if you wish.

### Tweet embedding

Note: This behavior is disabled by default for privacy reasons. See "Site configuration" section below to enable it.

You may include a tweet URL on its own line (like below), and it would be replaced with an official Twitter embed if the site configuration demands it.

https://twitter.com/jack/status/20

### Media embedding

You may embed media files within a note using HTML5 media tags. Here's an example for an audio file:

"Jazzy Frenchy" by Benjamin Tissot from bensound.com
<audio controls>
  <source src="/assets/jazzyfrenchy.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

### Site configuration

Some behavior is configurable by tweaking the `_config.yml` file.

**`use_html_extension`**: if you use a static host that doesn't support URLs that don't end with `.html` (such as Neocities), try changing the `use_html_extension` value to `true` in the `_config.yml` file and restart the Jekyll server (or re-build the site). This adds a `.html` extension to note URLs and may resolve issues with links. If you're still having trouble, I recommend using Netlify to host your digital garden: it's free, easy to use, and fully supports this template's features out of the box.

**`open_external_links_in_new_tab`**: when set to `true`, this makes external links open in new tabs. Set to `false` to open all links in the current tab.

**`embed_tweets`**: when set to `true`, tweet URLs on their own lines will be replaced with a Twitter embed. Default value is `false`.

### Automatic bi-directional links

Notice in the "Notes mentioning this note" section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes.

### Link previews

If you're on a device with mouse support, try hovering your mouse on internal links to preview the notes: [[a note about cats]].

Links that have been previewed will be cached to avoid redundant requests.

### Images and other Markdown goodies

Finally, because you have the full power of Markdown in this template, you can use regular Markdown syntax for various formatting options.

Lists work as expected:

- List element A
- List element B
- List element C

1. List element
2. List element
3. List element

If you'd like to quote other people, consider using quote blocks:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

And of course, images look great:

<img src="/assets/image.jpg"/>

You can also ==highlight some content== by wrapping it with `==`.

Non-latin languages are supported too: ==‰Ω†Â•Ω==, ==ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî==, ==„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ==.

### Code syntax highlighting

You can add code blocks with full syntax color highlighting by wrapping code snippet in triple backticks and specifying the type of the code (`js`, `rb`, `sh`, etc.):

```js
// Here's a bit of JavaScript:
console.log('hello!')
```

```rb
# And now some Ruby
def foo(bar)
  "baz"
end
```

```sh
$ cat /dev/urandom | grep "the answer to life" # shell scripts look nice too
```
